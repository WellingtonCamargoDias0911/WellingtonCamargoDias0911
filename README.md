ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub repository!  

I am passionate about programming and always eager to learn new things. I have completed the **Python 3 course from Basic to Advanced**, where I developed practical skills in various areas of the language, including:  

- **Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced Python**: From programming logic to object-oriented programming and design patterns.  
- **Automation and Web Development**: Building websites and APIs using Django, as well as practical automation with Selenium and PySide6 for graphical interfaces.  
- **Data Analysis and Databases**: Experience with relational databases like SQLite and MySQL, along with best practices in SQL.  
- **Automated Testing and Regular Expressions**: Creating robust and reliable scripts using TDD and RegEx.  

ðŸ’¡ Here on GitHub, I share projects that reflect this learning journey, focusing on practical solutions and experimentation.  

ðŸ“š I'm always improving my skills and open to collaborations and feedback. Feel free to explore the repositories and reach out! ðŸ˜Š
